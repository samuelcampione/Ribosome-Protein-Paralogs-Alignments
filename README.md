# Ribosome Protein Paralogs Alignments

Code and results for alignment visualizations of ribosomal subunit protein paralogs. Sequence data from the model organis, yeast (*S. cerevisiae*), was retreived from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) at [yeastgenome.com](yeastgenome.com).

Paralogs were limited to the 21 pairs with exactly matching AA protein sequence.

I used CLCG Genomics Workbench 23 for batched alignments of the paralogs.
