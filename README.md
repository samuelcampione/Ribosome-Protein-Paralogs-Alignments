# Ribosome Protein Paralogs Alignments

Alignment visualizations of ribosomal subunit protein paralogs--coding DNA [(cDNA)](https://github.com/samuelcampione/Ribosome-Protein-Paralogs-Alignments/tree/main/cDNA), genomic DNA [(gDNA)](https://github.com/samuelcampione/Ribosome-Protein-Paralogs-Alignments/tree/main/gDNA), and amina acid sequence [(protein)](https://github.com/samuelcampione/Ribosome-Protein-Paralogs-Alignments/tree/main/Protein).

Sequence data from the model organis, yeast (*S. cerevisiae*), was retreived from Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) at [yeastgenome.com](yeastgenome.com).

Paralogs were limited to the 21 pairs with exactly matching AA protein sequence.

I used CLCG Genomics Workbench 23 for batched alignments of the paralogs.
